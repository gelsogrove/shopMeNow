/**
 * F86 — Shared gate for every gather step that does verbatim accept.
 *
 * If the customer pivots to a trouble-machine signal mid-gather (e.g.
 * "ah, ahora no funciona la lavadora", "non parte la lavatrice",
 * "the dryer doesn't work"), this helper:
 *   - calls `pivotToTroubleMachine(ar)` atomically (clears the non-machine
 *     flow data, arms `activeBranch='trouble-machine'`, preserves sticky
 *     customer facts)
 *   - returns `true` to signal the caller MUST `return null` so the trouble
 *     pipeline takes over on the next pass / next turn
 *
 * Returns `false` when no pivot signal is detected — the caller proceeds
 * with the normal gather step.
 *
 * Iron rule #16 respected: ONE helper, ONE place. Adding a new non-machine
 * gather guard means importing this and calling it before the verbatim
 * assignment — no copy-paste of the detect/pivot logic.
 *
 * Consumers (per F86 architectural fix):
 *   - `utils/guards/invoice-flow.ts`        (in-flow switch block)
 *   - `utils/guards/discount-code-flow.ts`  (4 await-* steps)
 *   - `utils/guards/payment-double-charge.ts` (4 gather steps)
