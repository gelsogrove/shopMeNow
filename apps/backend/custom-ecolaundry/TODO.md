## 🚧 Open items

### 1. Promote thin branch handlers to "full" (architectural — Phase G)
**What:** 4 of 6 branch handlers are still "thin" (return `handoff: 'delegate-to-legacy'`):
`trouble-machine`, `invoice`, `loyalty`, `escalation`. They classify via the
T1 LLM router but the legacy guard pipeline produces the actual reply.

**Why blocking:** until they are full, turning on `useBranchRouter=true`
adds latency (~500ms) and cost (~$0.0005 per T1 message) without delivering
the multilingual benefit.

**Done when:** each handler owns its full reply pipeline (per-language JSON,
state machine, no fallback to legacy guards).

**Where to start:** `utils/branches/<branch>/handler.ts` + look at
`greeting/handler.ts` and `faq/handler.ts` as the reference for "full".

---

### 2. Multi-language activation (single milestone)
**What:** the system is ES-only in production today. When a 2nd language
goes live, the following must be done together as ONE migration:

1. **Flip `json/settings.json:enabledLanguages`** → add the new language code.
2. **Activate `useBranchRouter=true`** — multilingual intent classification
   becomes worth its cost (+500ms / +$0.0005 per T1) once 2+ languages
   share the same router.
3. **Port `utils/escalation.ts` summary builder to i18n** — ~30 hardcoded ES
   phrases for operator handover must move to `json/i18n/<lang>.json` with
   per-language tests. Today an exemption to rule #8 (documented in CLAUDE.md).
4. **Move FAQ topic regex to LLM** — `HORARIOS_TOPIC`, `PRECIO_TOPIC`,
   `TARJETA_TOPIC`, `RECARGA_TOPIC`, `FACTURA_TOPIC` are regex-based intent
   classifiers (rule #6 exemption). Reroute via the LLM with a slim
   system-prompt section listing FAQ keys, then delete the topic regexes.
5. **Per-language agent tests** for the new language (mirror of the ES
   acceptance tests in `__tests__/agent/`).

**Decision rule (Andrea, 2026-05-08):** all the above stay deferred until
the 2nd language is being onboarded. Today: 1 language live → keep deferred.

**Tracked in memory** (`project_use_branch_router.md`).

**Where:**
- `json/settings.json` (flip)
- `utils/escalation.ts` (ES phrases → i18n)
- `utils/guards/hours-and-pricing.ts`, `loyalty-card-buy.ts`,
  `loyalty-card-recharge.ts`, `invoice-flow.ts` (FAQ topic regex)
- `__tests__/agent/<lang>/*` (per-language tests)

---

### 3. Topic-switch protocol (Phase F)
**What:** the bot does not yet handle a clean topic-switch mid-flow. Example:
the customer is in DOOR flow ("¿qué aparece en la pantalla?" → "DOOR" →
instruction) and suddenly asks "¿qué horarios tenéis?" — the legacy guard
pipeline answers the FAQ but the active flow is not cleanly suspended.

**Why blocking:** real customers do this. The architecture supports it via
`activeBranch + previousBranch + handoff: 'topic-switch'` in the branch
router, but the implementation is partial.

**Done when:** `utils/branches/index.ts` honours `topic-switch` handoff →
re-routes on T+1 → restores `previousBranch` if appropriate.

---

### 4. Tool validator for `set_*` operations
**What:** [`prompts/agent.txt`](prompts/agent.txt) contains a behavioural
patch around line 583 ("DO NOT set_X if Y"). Per rule #1 (no patches in
prompt), this should be enforced by a validator on the corresponding tool
handler.

**Done when:** the prompt patch is removed AND the tool handler returns an
actionable error message that the LLM reads and corrects.

**Where:** `utils/agent-tools.ts` (schemas) + `utils/tool-handlers/*.ts`.

---

### 5. Display change mid-flow (preemption)
**What:** Phase B re-ask escalates regardless of whether the customer
provides a NEW display token in the second reply. Example:
- DOOR flow active → instruction → "no funciona" → Phase B re-ask "¿qué
  pantalla?" → customer says "SEL" instead of "DOOR" → bot escalates
  DOOR-related when it should pivot to SEL flow.

**Done when:** Phase B re-ask detects a different display token and pivots
the flow instead of escalating the original one.

**Where:** `utils/guards/display.ts:guardPostInstructionFailure`.

---

### 6. Agent-test flakiness on Phase B/C escalation
**What:** Tests asserting escalation immediately after the customer signals
"sigue igual" / "no arranca" sometimes pass and sometimes need an extra
turn (Phase B re-ask, then Phase C escalate). The architecture is correct
(2-step escalation prevents premature handover), but the LLM occasionally
escalates directly, occasionally re-asks first.

**Mitigation done:** tests now tolerate both paths (re-ask + confirm display
+ escalate) and assert on the final escalation reaching the name-ask phase.

**Done when:** the bot's behaviour on this transition is fully deterministic
(deterministic Phase B/C state machine in code, not LLM-driven).

**Where:** `utils/guards/display.ts:guardPostInstructionFailure` +
`__tests__/agent/06-escalar`, `07-door`, `08-sel`, `12-pagado-no-usado`.

---

### 7. Acceptance-criteria gap: negative assertions ("the bot must NOT say X")

**What:** the `Criterios de aceptación` in `docs/usecases.md` for Casos
13, 18, 19, 25, 28 explicitly state that the bot must **NOT** confront,
accuse, or contradict the customer. Examples: "no acusar al cliente",
"no decir 'te equivocas'", "no minimizar el malestar". These are
NEGATIVE assertions and they are not enforced by any test today. The
prompt's TONE & EMPATHY section documents the rule for the LLM, but
nothing automated catches a regression.

**Why this matters:** a single LLM hallucination in the wrong direction
("eso no puede ser, has hecho algo mal") would breach trust on the most
sensitive cases (angry customer, suspected fraud, contradictory
narrative) and we'd find out only via customer complaint.

**Done when:** every escalation-flavour test (Casos 13, 18, 19, 25, 28
and the angry-customer / contradictory branches of Caso 6) asserts
`expectMentionsNone(reply, FORBIDDEN_BLAME_TOKENS)` where the array
includes (at minimum): `te equivocas`, `mientes`, `no es verdad`,
`imposible`, `eso no es así`, `has hecho algo mal`. The list lives in
`__tests__/agent/_helpers.ts` so it is reused.

**Where:**
- New helper: extend `__tests__/agent/_helpers.ts` with
  `FORBIDDEN_BLAME_TOKENS` + `expectNoBlame(reply)` wrapper.
- Apply to: `__tests__/agent/16-fraude-incoherencia.test.spec.ts`,
  `24-enfadado.test.spec.ts`, `28-relato-contradictorio.test.spec.ts`,
  `30-codigo-numerico.test.spec.ts`, the Caso 19/20 specs in
  `cross/05-location-gated-21-24.test.spec.ts`, and the Scenario 6.2/6.3
  blocks in `14-doble-pago.test.spec.ts`.

**Effort:** ~1.5h (helper + ~6 test files).

### 8. Acceptance-criteria gap: emoji-policy enforcement

**What:** the prompt defines a strict emoji policy
(`prompts/agent.txt` → 😊 EMOJI POLICY): max 1 per reply, only at the
end, only on closing-question / positive-resolution / first-contact
empathy, NEVER on escalation / error / lists / replies with external URLs.
Today this is documentation only — the LLM follows it most of the time,
but there's no deterministic enforcement.

**Why this matters:** spurious emojis on escalation handover ("vamos a
revisar tu caso 🙂") feel inappropriate and break the formal tone the
operator hand-off requires. It's the kind of regression no one notices
until a customer screenshots it.

**Done when:** an output-invariant in `utils/output-invariants.ts`
(L5 layer) counts emojis in the reply and:
1. If `count > 1` — strip down to the first one only.
2. If the reply matches an escalation pattern (contains
   `revisar`, `operador revisar`, `human support`, the L5 invariant
   adds `desactivado` etc.) — strip ALL emojis from the body.
3. Add a sibling unit test
   `__tests__/unit/emoji-policy-invariant.test.ts` covering: 0/1/2/3
   emoji inputs, escalation-with-emoji input, link-with-emoji input.

**Where:**
- `utils/output-invariants.ts` (add `stripEmojiOverflow` /
  `stripEmojiOnEscalation`).
- `agent.ts:polishReplyForTurn` already routes through
  `applyOutputInvariants`, so wiring is one line.
- Test scaffolding mirrors existing `output-invariants.test.ts` if
  present, otherwise create.

**Effort:** ~2h (regex for emoji detection is well-known, but tone
detection on "is this an escalation?" needs care — start from a tight
keyword list).

### 9. Acceptance-criteria gap: insistence cap on Caso 31 (no location)

**What:** Caso 31's `Criterios de aceptación` says the bot insists on
the location for "2-3 intentos" and then escalates if the customer can't
or won't identify the laundry. Today the test (`32-no-local.test.spec.ts`)
covers ONE round of insistence. There is no test that pushes the bot
through 3 failed attempts in a row to verify it eventually escalates.
Also the cap itself (when does the bot give up?) is implicit in the
LLM, not encoded in code.

**Why this matters:** without a hard cap, a customer who refuses to
give a location could trap the bot in an infinite re-ask loop (turn
budget burns, session never escalates). Andrea has flagged in CLAUDE.md
that "do not loop" is a sacred rule.

**Done when:**
1. `state.locationClarificationCount` (already exists in `state.ts`)
   triggers a deterministic escalation when it reaches 3 — guard added
   in `utils/guards/location-resolution.ts:guardInsistLocation`.
2. New agent test `32-no-local.test.spec.ts` scenario: customer says
   "no lo sé" three times in a row → 3rd reply is an escalation
   (`expectEscalation(reply)`) AND the bot asks for the name.
3. New unit test on the guard verifies the count → escalate transition.

**Where:**
- `utils/guards/location-resolution.ts` — extend `guardInsistLocation`.
- `__tests__/agent/32-no-local.test.spec.ts` — add insistence-cap test.
- `__tests__/unit/location-resolution.test.ts` (or create if absent).

**Effort:** ~1h.

## 📐 Conventions for adding to this list

- One section per item, with a clear "Done when" so closure is unambiguous.
- Reference file paths so the next person can start without context.
- If an item turns into a doc decision (architecture, exemption, …), move
  the long-form rationale to `docs/` and keep the TODO entry pointing there.
- Closed items go to git history, not back into this file as "✅ done".
